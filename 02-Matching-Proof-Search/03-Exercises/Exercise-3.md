Here is a tiny lexicon and mini grammar with only one rule which defines a
sentence as consisting of five words: an article, a noun, a verb, and again an
article and a noun.

```prolog
word(article,a).
word(article,every).
word(noun,criminal).
word(noun,'big kahuna burger').
word(verb,eats).
word(verb,likes).
```

```prolog
sentence(Word1,Word2,Word3,Word4,Word5) :-
    word(article, Word1),
    word(noun, Word2),
    word(verb, Word3),
    word(article, Word4),
    word(noun, Word5).
```

What query do you have to pose in order to find out which sentences the
grammar can generate? 

```prolog
?- sentence(A, B, C, D, E).
```

List all sentences that this grammar can generate in the
order Prolog will generate them.
