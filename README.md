Welcome to the "Learn Prolog Now!" Exercises Repository. This repository is dedicated to storing the code solutions and exercises completed while working through the "Learn Prolog Now!" book. Prolog is a powerful logic programming language, and this resource aims to help learners master its concepts and applications.

## About "Learn Prolog Now!"

"Learn Prolog Now!" is a comprehensive online course and textbook designed to teach Prolog programming from the basics to advanced topics. The book covers fundamental Prolog concepts, logical reasoning, and practical applications through a series of engaging exercises.
